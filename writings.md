### Opening windows

It was raining outside for a while; I couldn't handle staying in anymore.<br>

But felt equally unwilling to leave work and go out in the weather.<br>

Something clicked: I craved not escape but connection - to feel the moist, cool breeze on my face, witness fresh radiant leaflets, and breathe in the petrichor rising from the rain-kissed soil.<br>

I went ahead and opened my windows.<br>
