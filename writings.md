### Opening windows

It's raining outside for a while; I can't stay in anymore.<br>

Yet feeling equally unwilling to leave work and go out in the weather.<br>

Something clicks: I crave not escape but connection - to feel the moist, cool breeze on my face, witness fresh radiant leaflets, and breathe in the petrichor rising from the rain-kissed soil.<br>

I go ahead and open my windows.<br>
