### A Question

_by Robert Frost_

A voice said, Look me in the stars<br>
And tell me truly, men of earth,<br>
If all the soul-and-body scars<br>
Were not too much to pay for birth.

### जो बीत गई सो बात गई

_by हरिवंश राय बच्चन_

जीवन में एक सितारा था<br>
माना वह बेहद प्यारा था<br>
वह डूब गया तो डूब गया<br>
अम्बर के आनन को देखो<br>
कितने इसके तारे टूटे<br>
कितने इसके प्यारे छूटे<br>
जो छूट गए फिर कहाँ मिले<br>
पर बोलो टूटे तारों पर<br>
कब अम्बर शोक मनाता है<br>
जो बीत गई सो बात गई

### Our Deepest Fear

_by Marianne Williamson_

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.<br>
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br>
It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.<br>
We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,<br>
talented and fabulous?<br>

Actually, who are you not to be?<br>
You are a child of God.<br>
Your playing small does not serve the world.<br>
There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other<br>
people won’t feel insecure around you.<br>

We were born to make manifest the glory of<br>
God that is within us.<br>

It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone.<br>
And as we let our own light shine,<br>
we unconsciously give other people<br>
permission to do the same.<br>

As we are liberated from our own fear,<br>
Our presence automatically liberates others.
