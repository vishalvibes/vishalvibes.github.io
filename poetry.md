### A Question

_by Robert Frost_

A voice said, Look me in the stars<br>
And tell me truly, men of earth,<br>
If all the soul-and-body scars<br>
Were not too much to pay for birth.

### जो बीत गई सो बात गई

_by हरिवंश राय बच्चन_

जीवन में एक सितारा था<br>
माना वह बेहद प्यारा था<br>
वह डूब गया तो डूब गया<br>
अम्बर के आनन को देखो<br>
कितने इसके तारे टूटे<br>
कितने इसके प्यारे छूटे<br>
जो छूट गए फिर कहाँ मिले<br>
पर बोलो टूटे तारों पर<br>
कब अम्बर शोक मनाता है<br>
जो बीत गई सो बात गई

### Our Deepest Fear

_by Marianne Williamson_

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.
We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,
talented and fabulous?

Actually, who are you not to be?
You are a child of God.
Your playing small does not serve the world.
There’s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other
people won’t feel insecure around you.

We were born to make manifest the glory of
God that is within us.

It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone.
And as we let our own light shine,
we unconsciously give other people
permission to do the same.

As we are liberated from our own fear,
Our presence automatically liberates others.
