Hey ðŸ‘‹,

I am Vishal. Consider me a science nerd, who loves to build projects that intrigue his curiosity ðŸ”®.

My core interest lies in computers and deep tech. I also have a knack for design, music, art, and literature.

Right after college, I went ahead to start India's First Developer Marketing Agency - [Sarg](https://sarg.io/), through which I helped some of the renowned DevTools startups reach their audience organically.

I completed my graduation from [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Indian Institute of Information Technology Ranchi](https://iiitranchi.ac.in/) in 2022, where I spent most of my time contributing to open-source projects and participating in coding contests. For a short while, I worked at [Zeotap](https://zeotap.com/) as a Data Engineer Intern and learned a lot about startups.

Currently, I am working on my new project, [Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.to). Which is like GitHub for People Facing teams.

When I'm not building stuff, I am playing the piano or reading anything from poetry to quantum physics.
